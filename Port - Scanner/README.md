# 🔍 Port Scanner (Python)

⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY – PLEASE READ FIRST** ⚠️

This project is a **Python-based port scanner created strictly for educational purposes**.  
It is designed to help beginners understand **networking fundamentals**, **socket programming**, and **how port scanning works internally**.

❗ **Do NOT use this tool to scan systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.**  
Unauthorized port scanning may be illegal in your country.

## 📚 About the Project

This repository walks you through building **your first real network tool** using **Python**.

You will learn:
- how ports and services work
- how to communicate over TCP sockets
- how scanners detect open ports
- how to safely handle timeouts and errors

This is **not** a professional or aggressive scanner - it is intentionally simple and readable for learning.

## 🧠 Learning Topics Covered

The project is structured step-by-step:

1. **Environment Setup & Required Libraries**  
   - Python environment preparation  
   - Using built-in networking libraries

2. **Scanning a Single Port**  
   - TCP connection attempts  
   - Detecting open and closed ports

3. **Implementing Timeouts**  
   - Preventing hangs  
   - Improving scan reliability

4. **Resolving Domain Names to IP Addresses**  
   - DNS resolution  
   - Working with hostnames

5. **Scanning Multiple Targets**  
   - Looping through ports  
   - Efficient scanning logic

6. **Banner Grabbing from Open Ports**  
   - Identifying services  
   - Basic service fingerprinting
