## 🛡️ Vulnerability Scanner (Python)

## ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY – PLEASE READ FIRST ⚠️

This project is a Python-based vulnerability scanner created strictly for educational purposes.
It demonstrates how basic port scanning results can be analyzed and translated into potential security issues.

❗ Do NOT use this tool to scan systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.
Unauthorized vulnerability scanning may be illegal in your country.

## 📚 About the Project

This repository expands on a basic port scanner and introduces the fundamentals of a vulnerability scanner.

Instead of only detecting open ports, the project focuses on:
- structuring scanning logic properly
- using object-oriented design
- mapping open services to potential vulnerabilities

The scanner is intentionally simple and readable, designed for learning and experimentation—not real-world exploitation.
